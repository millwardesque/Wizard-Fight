# Wizard-Fight
A mobile game in which you fight other wizards. Quickly.

# Core Ideas
* A made-for-bus-rides three-way fight with menu-based combat a la Pokemon
* Fights should last no more than 30 seconds (or something similar)
* Combat is executed simultaneously, like paper-scissor-rock
* Characters have different abilities and elemental affinities
* Rapid countdown timer for selection to increase urgency
* Local AI opponents, online multiplayer
* AI + multiplayer when only two participants are available.
* One-hand/One-finger GUI.
* Super-fast fight restart
